### What I learned

In completing the "Huddle Landing Page with Single Introductory Section" challenge, I learned a lot about organizing components in React.js. I packed all the reusable data into components to keep things structured and maintainable. One important takeaway was that I couldn’t use Sass directly in my React project without first installing the package, which was a key lesson. Additionally, I explored using the "React Icons" module for creating the contact section, which made integrating icons much easier. This challenge helped me improve both my React and Sass skills while enhancing my understanding of component-based development.

### Continued development

I plan to focus on improving the responsiveness of the page to ensure it looks great on all screen sizes. I also want to add more interactivity, such as hover effects or animations, to enhance user engagement. To deepen my knowledge of React, I’ll explore more advanced state management techniques and consider using React Router for navigation between sections. Additionally, I’ll refine my Sass skills by learning more about mixins and variables to make the styling even more efficient and scalable. Lastly, I'll work on optimizing performance, ensuring the page loads quickly and smoothly.
